	abstract = {If you already know the basics of Node.js, now is the time to discover how to bring it to production level by leveraging its vast ecosystem of packages. As a web developer, you'll work with a varied collection of standards and frameworks - Practical Node.js shows you how all those pieces fit together. Practical Node.js takes you from installing all the necessary modules to writing full-stack web applications by harnessing the power of the Express.js and Hapi frameworks, the {MongoDB} database with Mongoskin and Mongoose, Jade and Handlebars template engines, Stylus and {LESS} {CSS} languages, {OAuth} and Everyauth libraries, and the Socket.{IO} and Derby libraries, and everything in between. The book also covers how to deploy to Heroku and {AWS}, daemonize apps, and write {REST} {APIs}. You'll build full-stack real-world Node.js apps from scratch, and also discover how to write your own Node.js modules and publish them on {NPM}. What you'll learn: Manipulate data from the mongo console; Use the Mongoskin and Mongoose {MongoDB} libraries; Build {REST} {API} servers with Express and Hapi; Deploy apps to Heroku and {AWS}; Test services with Mocha, Expect and {TravisCI}; Utilize sessions for authentication; Implement a third-party {OAuth} strategy with Everyauth; Apply Redis, domains, {WebSockets}, and clusters; Write your own Node.js module, and publish it on {NPM}. --},

	abstract = {Since it's creation in 2009, Node.js has grown into a powerful and increasingly popular asynchronous-development framework for creating highly-scalable network applications using {JavaScript}. Respected companies such as Dow Jones and {LinkedIn} are among the many organizations to have seen Node's potential and adopted it into their businesses. Pro Node.js for Developers provides a comprehensive guide to this exciting new technology. We introduce you to Node -- what it is, why it matters and how to set it up -- before diving deeply into the key concepts and {APIs} that underpin its operation. Building upon your existing {JavaScript} skills you'll be shown how to use Node.js to build both Web- and Network-based applications, to deal with data sources, capture events and deal with child processes to create robust applications that will work well in a wide range of circumstances. Once you've mastered these skills we'll go further, teaching you more advanced software engineering skills that will give your code a professional edge. You'll learn how to create easily reusable modules that will save you time through code reuse, to log and debug your applications quickly and effectively and to write code that will scale easily and reliably as the demand for your application grows.},
